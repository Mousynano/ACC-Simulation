4. Rentang mutasi. The mutation range that limits the mutation search area. For example, if mutation range is 0.1 then the mutated param will be x - 0.1 < x < x + 0.1, and so on.
5. Waktu training. The time required for the program to run each generation
6. Gear button. Used to determine if the optimizer is running or not, if it moves then it will run the iteration.
7. Play/pause button. Determines if the program is currently running or not.
